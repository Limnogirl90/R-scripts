# everything is significant, but it seems like there are really strong patterns here with year. Most (about 60%?) of the change in deviance is due to Year. I assume it is year that is of most interest.
# note from the univariate tests, that even after adjusting for multiple testing, there are significant year effects in ALL taxa. This is unusual.

# have more of a look at where the action is, from univariate test statistics:
an.snails$uni.test
# the big stats are mostly for year (fourth row)
sort(an.snails$uni.test[4,],decreasing=TRUE)
# the taxa that seem to have the strongest change over time are Elimia, Dreissena polymorpha, Acari, Gammarus faciatus

# this isn't the prettiest plot. Different colours for different years, different symbols for Habitat.
# you can see:
# - that there is a lot of variation across reps within site (some is due to habitat, e.g. strong effect in ..polymorpha, ...bugensis and ...gammarus)
# - many taxa have dropped to zero abundance at 2014, including the two most with strongest year effect (Elimia and D poly).
# - A few have started at zero in 1983 and moved up from there (including Acari)
# Might be worth using a line graph to visualise effects for each species?

# try a line plot of the means:
source("default.meanvar.plot.R") # to use the updated function that makes it easier to extract means
